What is your site's primary purpose?
---
The primary purpose of my website is to be a learning tool, to experiment with and to implement new skills and techniques leant in this course.

My website will also show others my skills and what I have learnt.

Who is your target audience?
---
My target audience is the rest of my cohort, the EDA coaches and potential employers. People that appreciate a well-designed website and can tell good website design from bad.
How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?

I would like visitors to have an effortless experience and to be able to navigate through the site in an intuitive way and for all the information they want / I want to see to be presented in a clear and concise way.

Also it would be really cool to have something the surprises and impresses visitors and is also helpful to the expression of information.

How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?
---
I will need to start with a simple layout that is intuitive for visitors. This will mean modelling the layout to a certain extent on standard site layouts.

I will then need to come up with a layout theme that will work for the different areas of my site both in full screen and in mobile view.
